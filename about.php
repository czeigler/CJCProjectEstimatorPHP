    <h3><br>About the CJC Project Estimator</h3>
    
     <p>This CJC project is a variable costs project estimation tool.</p>
<p>There are many small businesses and craftsmen who need to estimate materials and labor for custom projects. These projects most often have different materials, costs, hours, and labor rates. For example, a carpenter, tailor, or landscaper may all need to bid projects based on an estimate of labor and materials. The proposed project would address this need by building a project estimation tool that allowed for variable material, labor, and costs. In addition, the project would keep track of multiple projects where the user could record actual costs and then look at an aggregated data report to see resources, and labor project estimation tool for this target audience.</p> 
<p>The projectâ€™s purpose is to build an effective online tool for the target audience of a craftsman/craftswoman or small business. 
</p>
   <p> The estimator tool was developed by Christopher Allen, Jeremy Eichelberger, and Christopher Zeigler for CIS 665 at Colorado State University.</p>
   <p>In about 5 minutes you can build a project estimate including materials and labor.</p>
